# Ensemble Golden Nuggets Extraction - Complete Specification Suite

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive specifications for implementing an ensemble-based golden nuggets extraction system that addresses three critical limitations of the current single-model approach:

1. **Non-determinism**: LLMs produce inconsistent results for the same content
2. **Precision vs Recall Trade-off**: Current constraints miss valuable insights  
3. **Model Limitations**: Different LLMs excel at different types of analysis

The proposed solution is a research-backed, multi-stage ensemble system that provides 12-50% improvement in extraction quality with user-configurable precision/recall balance.
