# Content Scripts Architecture

This document covers the content script architecture, extraction system, and UI management for the Golden Nugget Finder extension.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNING - Content Script Matches

**NEVER change the content script matches pattern to `<all_urls>` or any broad pattern.**

The content script in `src/entrypoints/content.ts` is configured with:
```typescript
matches: ['https://example.com/*'] // Restrictive pattern - DO NOT CHANGE
```

**Why this restriction exists:**
- Changing to `<all_urls>` causes Chrome to reload every open tab when the extension loads
- This creates terrible UX and user frustration
- The extension uses dynamic injection via `chrome.scripting.executeScript()` instead
- Content scripts are injected only when needed via context menu actions

**The correct approach:**
- Keep the restrictive matches pattern
- Use dynamic injection in `background.ts` to inject content scripts on demand
- Inject `content-scripts/content.js` using `chrome.scripting.executeScript()`

## Content Script Overview

Content scripts are injected dynamically only when needed (not on all pages) and handle:
- Content extraction from webpages using the `threads-harvester` library
- DOM manipulation for highlighting and UI rendering with design system integration
- Analysis workflow and performance monitoring with real-time progress updates
- Communication with background scripts via message passing
- Multi-provider analysis support with provider metadata display
- Ensemble mode UI integration with confidence scoring and consensus visualization

## Content Extraction System

The content extraction system uses the external `threads-harvester` library for intelligent content extraction across different website types.

### ContentScraper (`threads-harvester`)
The extension uses `ContentScraper` from the threads-harvester library which provides:
- **Automatic Site Detection**: Automatically detects site type (Reddit, Hacker News, generic websites)
- **Structured Content Extraction**: Returns structured `Content` objects with `items` array containing posts and comments
- **HTML Support**: Can include HTML content for better extraction with `includeHtml: true` option
- **Interactive Selection**: Supports checkbox-based content selection with custom styling

### Content Processing Flow
1. **Initialization**: `ContentScraper` is created with design-system-compliant checkbox styling
2. **Extraction**: `contentScraper.run()` extracts structured content from the page
3. **Conversion**: `convertContentToText()` converts structured content to text with type delimiters (`[POST]`, `[COMMENT]`)
4. **Analysis**: Processed text is sent to AI for golden nugget analysis

### Site-Specific Extraction
The threads-harvester library handles site-specific extraction internally:
- **Reddit**: Handles modern Reddit's shadow DOM structure and both old/new layouts
- **Hacker News**: Optimized for classic HTML structure with nested comments
- **Generic Sites**: Fallback extraction for unknown site structures
- **Content Types**: Distinguishes between posts, comments, and article content

## UI Management

### UI Manager (`ui/ui-manager.ts`)
Orchestrates all UI interactions and coordinates between components:
- Manages lifecycle of UI components
- Handles state synchronization
- Coordinates highlighting and sidebar display

### Highlighter (`ui/highlighter.ts`)
Modern text highlighting using CSS Custom Highlight API with DOM fallback and enhanced text matching:
- **CSS Custom Highlight API**: Uses modern browser API for performance and native behavior
- **DOM Fallback**: Graceful degradation to DOM-based highlighting for older browsers
- **Enhanced Text Matching Integration**: Uses `EnhancedTextMatchingAdapter` for improved accuracy and reliability
- **Multi-Strategy Matching**: Combines exact matching, fuzzy matching, and content reconstruction for robust highlighting
- **Ultra-Subtle Styling**: Uses design system's minimal gray overlays for sophisticated highlighting
- **Minimal Visual Impact**: Small, unobtrusive indicators with hover states using design system colors
- **Performance Optimized**: CSS-based highlighting with intelligent caching avoids DOM manipulation overhead
- **Accessibility**: Maintains proper contrast while being visually minimal using neutral grays

### Sidebar (`ui/sidebar.ts`)
Displays results in right sidebar with Notion-inspired design:
- **Clean Layout**: Uses design system colors and spacing
- **Card-based Design**: Subtle shadows and borders for content hierarchy
- **Minimal Interactions**: Hover states and smooth transitions
- **Typography**: System font stack with consistent sizing

### NotificationManager (`ui/notifications.ts`)
Manages different types of notification banners with automatic lifecycle:
- **Multiple Banner Types**: Progress, error, success, info, API key error, and provider-specific banners
- **Real-time Progress**: Displays analysis progress with provider information and timing
- **Provider Integration**: Shows provider metadata, response times, and model information
- **Ensemble Progress Support**: Specialized notifications for multi-run analysis with run counters
- **Rate Limiting Support**: Displays rate limiting messages with retry countdown
- **Auto-hide Behavior**: Automatic timeout for errors and success messages
- **Interactive Options**: Info banners can include buttons with custom actions
- **Single Banner Policy**: Only one banner shown at a time, with smart replacement
- **Design System Integration**: Uses design system colors, typography, and timing
- **Smooth Animations**: Fade-in and slide-in animations for professional feel

### Ensemble Mode UI Integration

Content script UI components include specialized features for ensemble mode analysis:

#### Enhanced Notification System
Ensemble-specific progress notifications with run tracking:
- **Ensemble Progress Messages**: Real-time updates during multi-run analysis
- **Run Counter**: Shows current run progress (e.g., "Run 2 of 3")
- **Cost Indication**: Clear display of multiplied API costs
- **Consensus Building**: Progress messages during similarity matching

#### Sidebar Ensemble Results
Enhanced sidebar display for ensemble analysis results:
- **Confidence Scoring**: Visual indicators showing nugget confidence levels
- **Consensus Metadata**: Run agreement statistics (e.g., "3/3 runs" or "2/3 runs")
- **Quality Indicators**: Visual cues for high-confidence vs moderate-confidence nuggets
- **Ensemble Badges**: Subtle indicators showing analysis was performed with ensemble mode

#### Example Ensemble UI Elements
```typescript
// Ensemble-specific progress notification
const ensembleProgressMessage = `üéØ Starting ensemble extraction (${runs} runs)`

// Consensus display in sidebar
const consensusElement = document.createElement('div')
consensusElement.style.cssText = `
  background: ${colors.background.secondary};
  border: 1px solid ${colors.border.light};
  border-radius: 4px;
  padding: ${spacing.xs};
  color: ${colors.text.secondary};
  font-size: ${typography.fontSize.xs};
`
consensusElement.textContent = `${runsSupportingThis}/${totalRuns} agreement`
```

#### Ensemble Mode Visual Design
- **Confidence Indicators**: Subtle opacity variations based on consensus strength
- **Agreement Badges**: Small text indicators showing run agreement
- **Enhanced Cards**: Additional metadata sections for ensemble-specific information
- **Cost Awareness**: Clear visual indicators when ensemble mode is active

### Design System Integration
Content script UI components follow the shared design system:
- **Color Consistency**: All components use the same ultra-minimal gray palette
- **Typography**: System font stack for consistent reading experience
- **Spacing**: 8-step spacing scale for proper visual hierarchy
- **Shadows**: Subtle shadows for depth without visual noise
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and animations for professional feel
- **Z-Index Management**: Proper layering with defined z-index values

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Never Use Hardcoded Design Values in Content Scripts

**ABSOLUTELY NEVER use hardcoded colors, shadows, spacing, or any design values in content script UI components.**

**All styling MUST reference the design system:**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Always import and use design system
import { colors, shadows, spacing, generateInlineStyles } from '../../shared/design-system'

// For dynamic styling in content scripts
element.style.cssText = `
  background: ${colors.background.primary};
  color: ${colors.text.primary};
  box-shadow: ${generateInlineStyles.cardShadow()};
  padding: ${spacing.md};
`

// For hover effects
element.addEventListener('mouseover', () => {
  element.style.boxShadow = generateInlineStyles.cardShadowHover()
  element.style.borderColor = colors.border.medium
})
```

**FORBIDDEN patterns in content scripts:**
```typescript
// ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS
element.style.backgroundColor = 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)'
element.style.color = '#1A1A1A'
element.style.boxShadow = '0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)'
```

**Why this is critical for content scripts:**
- Content scripts inject UI into arbitrary websites
- Hardcoded values break visual consistency across different sites
- Design system ensures our Notion-inspired aesthetic is preserved
- Makes UI components maintainable and themeable
- Prevents style conflicts with host website styles

**Content script components that MUST use design system:**
- `ui/highlighter.ts` - All highlighting and indicator styles
- `ui/sidebar.ts` - All sidebar and card styles  
- `ui/notifications.ts` - All banner and notification styles
- `ui/ui-manager.ts` - Any dynamic styling

**Remember: The design system (`../../shared/design-system.ts`) is the single source of truth.**

## Site-Specific Behavior

The threads-harvester library provides automatic site detection and optimized extraction:

### Reddit Integration
- Automatic detection of modern Reddit interface
- Handles both old and new Reddit layouts seamlessly
- Extracts post content and comment threads with proper hierarchy
- Supports both standard and shadow DOM structures

### Hacker News Integration

- Test across different site types and structures
- Verify UI component interactions

### Working with ContentScraper
1. **Automatic Detection**: ContentScraper automatically detects site types - no manual configuration needed
2. **Design System Integration**: Configure extraction with design-system-compliant checkbox styling
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Use `measureContentExtraction()` to monitor extraction performance
4. **Multi-Mode Support**: Supports both analysis mode and selection mode with checkboxes
5. **Site Types**: Test extraction across Reddit, Hacker News, and generic websites
6. **Content Reconstruction**: Extracted content is stored for golden nugget text reconstruction

### UI Component Guidelines
- **Design System Compliance**: Always use design system variables for styling
- **Provider Integration**: Display provider metadata and response times in UI
- **Real-time Updates**: Handle progress messages and provider switching notifications
- **Performance Optimization**: Keep components lightweight with efficient DOM operations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for provider failures and network issues
